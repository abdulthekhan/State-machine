I had some difficulty with this lab, specifically with the delete and garbage commands. It took a while to figure out but I feel like it works perfectly now.

****VERY IMPORTANT*****

The series of commands that work in the terminal are listed below

COMMAND LIST:

[0] Go to state 0
[1] Go to state 1
[c 0/1 'State'] Change state
[p] print
[g] garbage
[d] delete state
[d 'State'] Check if states are deleted
[x] exit

**Hitting Enter multiple times tells you the present state of the state machine**
